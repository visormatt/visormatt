# Hi, I'm Matthew Scholta 👋

Driving **enterprise-wide technical initiatives**. Transforming legacy systems into **modern architectures**. Building scalable systems that enable **teams to ship faster**.

## 👨‍💻 Current Role

**Sr. Staff Engineer** at [Shiftsmart](https://shiftsmart.com)

- Driving enterprise-wide BullMQ, GraphQL, React Router, NestJS, and TypeScript adoption
- Leading microservice transformation from legacy monolith
- Building observability infrastructure
- Creating developer tooling and automation

## 🧩 In Progress

### Monorepo(s)

Actively managing and evolving this comprehensive monorepo, which serves as both a production environment and a proving ground for architectural patterns, developer experience improvements, and scalable infrastructure patterns. This monorepo houses complex applications and shared packages across multiple domains, requiring careful orchestration of dependencies, build pipelines, and deployment strategies.

The insights, patterns, and tooling developed here directly inform and enhance 2 critical Shiftsmart monorepos, where I'm applying these architectural advancements to improve developer productivity, reduce time-to-market, and establish consistent patterns across teams. This cross-pollination ensures that proven solutions from personal experimentation become battle-tested practices in enterprise environments.

**Highlights**:

- Custom NX generators for rapid service scaffolding and consistent project structure
- Multiple production applications spanning React Router, NestJS, and Expo ecosystems
- Shared packages and tooling that enforce consistency and reduce duplication
- Production-ready infrastructure with CI/CD, testing, and deployment automation
- Architectural patterns that scale from personal projects to enterprise monorepos

### [BarGuide](https://barguide.io/explore)

Living in San Francisco for 20+ years I've had my fair share of long nights out. As tiny as 7x7 square miles may sound, there are well over 700 locations you can go to enjoy a pint or other "adult beverage". As you might imagine this can leave you a bit overwhelmed when it comes to deciding where to go.

BarGuide.io solves this problem by providing a comprehensive search platform that focuses on the nuanced details that matter. Built with modern web technologies, the platform enables users to filter through hundreds of locations using an incredibly robust feature set, allowing them to find the perfect spot based on their specific preferences and needs.

### [RocketCMS](https://rocketcms.org)

RocketCMS is a modern content management system that revolutionizes how content is structured and managed. Unlike traditional CMS platforms where content models are predefined, RocketCMS uses a Server Driven UI approach where the content models are determined by the UI components you've designed. This architecture enables developers to build flexible, component-based content management systems that adapt to their specific needs.
